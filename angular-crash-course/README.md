## Development server (run the project)

Go to the root project directory and run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Project structure

node_modules - contains libraries which are required to run the application. This folder can be generated by 'npm install'  
src - contains all the resources of the application  
src -> app - main module is generated here. Angular app must have at least one module  
src -> styles.scss - global styles definitions  
src -> main.ts - entry point of the application  

_configuration for TypeScript:_  
tsconfig.app.json  
tsconfig.json  
tsconfig.spec.json  
  
package.json - this is analogue of pom.xml  
package-lock.json - each time I add new dependency this file will be updated  
angular.json - used by angular CLI to manage various setting for angular project  
  
_main component_  
src -> app -> app.component.html  
src -> app -> app.component.scss  
src -> app -> app.component.spec.ts  
src -> app -> app.component.ts  

_main module_  
src -> app -> app.module.ts - we have to register all related components here. Angular uses it to bootstrap the application
